                    <p>Hi I'm Jamie! I study Computer Science and Constitutional Studies at the University of Notre Dame. I am particularly interested in cyber security. I would like my future career to be an intersection of the two things I love most: coding and politics. I also love music and am a member of the Band of the Fighting Irish!</p>
