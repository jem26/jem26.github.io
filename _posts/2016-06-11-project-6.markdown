description: In a team of four members, I created a navigation program for students at the University of Notre Dame. The user could pick a starting and ending location, and the program would use a geodesic path-finding algorithm and image processing to find the shortest sidewalk path between those two points. The path was then illustrated on the map for the user to see.
